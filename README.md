# MatrixFactorization

Implement a matrix factorization method to predict student responses.

The purpose of this project is to build and refine machine learning models that can estimate a studentâ€™s likelihood of correctly answering specific diagnostic questions, based on their past performance and that of other students. Such models are crucial for educational platforms where personalized feedback and adaptive learning paths are used to enhance learning experiences.
